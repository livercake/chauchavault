remains in control of their private keys.

This licence covers any file belonging to the
LiteVault project (which is further owned by
Someguy123) that is not covered by an existing
licence prior to publishing.

Areas of the source code that are not covered by
this licence include external libraries such as
Bootstrap (both CSS and Javascript), BitcoinJS
(compiled version in assets), external modules
installed from package.json, and may extend to
other areas of the project at Someguy123's discretion.

PERMISSION IS GRANTED TO

  - run the service locally for
    - experimenting
    - security analysis
    - creating modifications (which are required to be
    made public under this same licence)

  - use the source code for educational purposes such as:
    - learning about cryptocurrency networks
    - understanding BitcoinJS
    - understanding the implementation of other libraries

If you want to use the source code for any other purpose,
for example running LiteVault for a different cryptocurrency,
you will need to contact Someguy123 (contact details are
  available on the LiteVault site)

In email communication, on December 17 2017, Someguy123 has granted
permission to fork LiteVault into ChauchaVault as long as all the code is released opensource
and attribution is kept on the site.
